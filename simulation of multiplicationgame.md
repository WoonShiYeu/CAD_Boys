Figure above shows the simulation result of Multiplicationgame.v. Let’s clarify the input and output first. In this simulation, since we cannot step down the clock speed, so we just use the clock speed that allowed in simulation. rst is used to reset the simulation or to challenge the game again. Start is always being set due to it is connected to VCC. For dataout1 and dataout2, they are the question of multiplication which suppose generated by RNG.v. However, in the simulation we do not know what number will be generated by RNG.v, so that we only can provide the question by ourselves by making sure the number is looked random. All the number in dataout1 and dataout2 are the number that possible to be appeared in the RNG.v.  dataout1 and dataout2 are also 2 different numbers, in order words, the player need to do the multiplication between these two numbers. For the input of the simulation, we are not able to apply GPIO_1 which is the inout of the keypad so that we are forced to change the input of the simulation into ans1 and ans0 to replace the data key in by keypad. Where ans1 and ans0 are 2 digits numbers, ans0 is first digit while ans1 is second digit. Which means, we are going to inserted the answer before the simulation to simulate the situation in real world. For ansout, they are grouped of the output of ans1led and ans0led, which is used to show the number inserted by the player. For marksout, it is also a grouped marks1led and marks0led to show the marks of player obtain when the game over. num1out and num2out are used to show the question of multiplication. timer is also grouped timer1led and timer0led to show the countdown of every question. For correctled, finishled and loseled, they are the indicator to indicate the correctness of the answer, the finishing of the game and losing of the game respectively once one of them are being lighted up. 
Part A: First we reset the system to make sure it is in the original mode. When the dataout1 and dataout2 give 3 and 4 respectively, we can multiply them to get 12. According to keypad, if we want to type 12, we have to press ‘1’ first then ‘2’. So, ‘1’ will be appear in ansout first in the first digit, then follow by ‘2’. Once the result is correct, the correctled will be set, which is lighted up in hardware. The timer will count down from 20 second. So, each question will provide 20 marks. Once we answer correctly, the remaining time will be our marks for that particular question. The timer will be refresh to 20 seconds when a new question started. Next, the question is 2 and 5, after we inserted 10, the correctled will be lighted up again and the timer is calculating the marks we obtained in this question. Same cases to the question of 7 with 4 and 6 with 6. On the fifth question, which is 5 and 7, once we type the correct answer 35, the correctled will be lighted up. Since we have done for 5 questions with consecutively correct, the finishled will be lighted up next. Once it lighted up, the system will give us the total marks, by summing up all the marks we get in these 5 questions, we obtained. 92/100 as shown in marksout.

Part B: Next, after finishled is lighted up, the game is overed and the timer will be cleared and set as 0. If we want to challenge the game again, we could press rst button to reset the game, so that the system will start the new game. In this case let’s say the question is 7 and 2. The answer should be 14, but when we give the wrong answer, it will happen nothing because of our wrong answer. However, we have the chance for inserted the answer again as long as it is less that the time provided which is 20 seconds. We also can see that the timer is still counting down although we provided the wrong answer. But right now we would like to simulate to investigate the losing of the game.

Part C: In this part, we can see that the timer is still counting down if we do nothing. At around 795ns, our timer is counting to 0 second. Once the time is up, that means we are losing the game. Therefore, loseled is lighted up to indicate that we have losed the game. If we want to start the game again, we just need to press the rst button again.


However, in the hardware implementation, we will use keypad to insert the answer, RNG.v to generate random number and using onesecclk and twoHzclk to slowdown the clock speed so that the system is operating in an appropriate speed

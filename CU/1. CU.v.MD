Coding above shows the Verilog of control unit while Figure above shows rtl-ASMchart of control unit. For the control unit, first we will stay in state S0. Once the player wants to start to play the game, he needed to press start. Once start is set, the output num1 and num2 will be assigned by value of tempnum1 and tempnum2 respectively, then we will move to state S1. tempnum1 and tempnum2 are the number that generated by RNG block and which is used to generate 2 random number for multiplication question purpose. Once these two numbers loaded into num1 and num2, there are viewable to the player so that the player can insert his own answer of multiplication of these 2 numbers. The comparison of between the value inserted by the player and the correct answer will be done in the data unit part. For the input correct, finish and lose, all of them will be received from data unit. At state S1, once the answer inserted by player is correct, the input correct will be set. Then the correctled output will be set as well and the state will go back so state S0 for next question. While for the finish, if the player can get the answer correct for 5 times consecutively, the input of finish will be set. The system will go to state S2 from state S1. At state S2, the finishled will be set to tell the player the game is finished and the marks will be showed to him. For lose, once the player answers incorrectly, the control unit will receive lose signal to indicate it go into state S3 from state S1 to tell the players that they are losing the game because they have answered the question wrongly. If the player wishes to restart the game, they can just simply press rst to reset the system back to state S0 with cleared marks.
